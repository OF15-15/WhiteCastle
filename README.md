# WhiteCastle

## Project goals
I qualified for the board game competition [europe masters](https://europemasters.eu), where the board game "The White Castle" is played. For some analysis and training, I want to put together a simple app with the two goals:
- ability to play online versus my team mates to train
- ability to simulate different strategies with npcs to test out different strategies

## The White Castle
The White Castle is a competitive, moderatly complex board game by Shei S. & Isra C., published by Devir Games. You can find the rules [here](https://dmmib.de/download/12604/?tmstv=1722888475)
The different components can be found here: https://devir.world/thewhitecastle/components_ENG.html
